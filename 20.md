# 2.0 Potentially BREAKING CHANGES

In order to enable further quick iterations on the mod and to keep up with the new pace of Minecraft versions,
I had to migrate to a new config system for the mod.

For most users, this should be an unnoticeable change but for some of you the following changes might be relevant:


## Configuration

The configuration file has moved from `config/inventorysorter/config.json5` to `config/inventorysorter.json`

The configuration _should_ automatically migrate, but it is recommended to check it after you have started the game with 2.0 once.

## Keybinds

Due to the migration of the configuration file (and the configuration library used), the sort keybind has been reset.
I tried to save it, but I couldn't find a way to do it.

Please rebind the key in the controls menu if you have changed it from the default.

## Where did the blacklist go?

The blacklist functionality has been renamed to a "Compatibility" list to better reflect what it does.

If you had a blacklist in the old configuration file, it should have been migrated to the new configuration file.
Instead of having a separate file for the blacklist, it is now part of the main configuration file.

The configuration options have been removed from the configuration screen itself for a few reasons:

- The default compatibility list is automatically loaded at startup, you don't need to press a button anymore
- The config screen was a bit fiddly and not very user-friendly (for the few people who actually used it)
- With upcoming changes I want to make the compatibility features more powerful and friendly for other mod developers to hook into

If you see any issues with the migration, please let me know on the issue tracker.
