Inventory Sorter is a lightweight mod that keeps your inventory clean with minimal effort.  
It’s used by millions of players across Modrinth and CurseForge.

Designed to run server-side, it works out of the box, even with **vanilla clients**, making it perfect 
for modpacks, multiplayer servers, and anyone who wants frictionless sorting without needing client-side mods.

It also works perfectly in **single-player**, since Minecraft runs an integrated server behind the scenes.

## Features

Inventory Sorter supports several ways to trigger a sort:

- Click the sort button (client mod required)
- Use the keybind (client mod required)
- Middle-click an empty slot (works with vanilla client)
- Double-click an empty slot (works with vanilla client)
- Use `/invsort sort` or `/invsort sortme` in chat (works with vanilla client)

The mod is designed to run server-side. 
Sorting actions like middle-click, double-click, and commands work even if the client has no mods installed. 
If you're using the optional client mod, you'll also get visual buttons, keybind support, and in-game configuration menus.

## Compatibility and Configuration

Inventory Sorter supports **all inventories**, including those from other mods. 
You can control where sorting is enabled, customize how it behaves, and hide UI elements for specific containers.

All configuration options are documented at:

## Dependencies

For client-side configuration and UI features, you’ll need:

- [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) (required)
- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) (optional, for easier access to config)

The mod functions server-side without any client dependencies.
