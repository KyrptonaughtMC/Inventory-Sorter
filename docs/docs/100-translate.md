# Help Translate Inventory Sorter

Inventory Sorter supports multiple languages thanks to community contributions.  
If you'd like to help bring the mod to more players around the world, we’d love your help.

## How to Contribute

We use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/inventory-sorter) to manage translations.  
It's a web-based platform that makes contributing simple—no coding required.

Just visit the project page, pick a language you know, and start translating:

[Crowdin Translation Portal →](https://crowdin.com/project/inventory-sorter)

You’ll see all the in-game text, configuration labels, screenshots and tooltips ready for translation or review.

## Who Can Help?

Anyone! If you:

- Speak a language other than English
- Play Minecraft in that language
- Want to help others enjoy the mod in their native tongue

…then you're exactly who we're looking for.

## Tips for Translators

- Stick to Minecraft's existing terminology where possible.  
  For example, use the same words Mojang uses for items, blocks, and actions.

- Keep translations clear and concise.  
  If a phrase sounds awkward when read aloud in your language, it's probably worth tweaking.

- You don’t need to finish a whole language to be helpful. Even fixing one unclear word improves the experience.

## Need Context?

Many of the translation keys show up in:

- Configuration menus
- Tooltips
- In-game messages
- Sort button hints

There are screenshots of the in-game text in Crowdin to help you understand where each string appears.
