## How to Contribute

We use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/inventory-sorter) to manage translations.  
It's a web-based platform that makes contributing simpleâ€”no coding required.

Just visit the project page, pick a language you know, and start translating:

[Crowdin Translation Portal â†’](https://crowdin.com/project/inventory-sorter)

Youâ€™ll see all the in-game text, configuration labels, screenshots and tooltips ready for translation or review.

## Who Can Help?

Anyone! If you:

- Speak a language other than English
- Play Minecraft in that language
- Want to help others enjoy the mod in their native tongue

â€¦then you're exactly who we're looking for.

## Tips for Translators

- Stick to Minecraft's existing terminology where possible.  
  For example, use the same words Mojang uses for items, blocks, and actions.

- Keep translations clear and concise.  
  If a phrase sounds awkward when read aloud in your language, it's probably worth tweaking.

- You donâ€™t need to finish a whole language to be helpful. Even fixing one unclear word improves the experience.

## Need Context?

Many of the translation keys show up in:

- Configuration menus
- Tooltips
- In-game messages
- Sort button hints

There are screenshots of the in-game text in Crowdin to help you understand where each string appears.
