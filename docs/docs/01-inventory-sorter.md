# Introduction

Inventory Sorter is a lightweight mod that helps keep inventories organized with minimal effort.

It is designed to run server-side first. This allows it to work even with vanilla clients, making it suitable for multiplayer servers, modpacks, and single-player worlds. It supports all inventories, including those added by other mods.

## Server-side-first design

Unlike most sorting mods, Inventory Sorter performs sorting on the server. The client sends a request, and the server applies the sort. This avoids simulating manual item movement from the client.

This approach enables:

- Sorting with unmodded clients (via commands, middle click, or double click)
- Cleaner networking in multiplayer
- Simplified deployment for modpacks and server operators

Client-side installation is optional. Without the client mod, users will not see a sort button, keybind, or config menu. These features are purely visual and do not affect core functionality.

There is an ongoing effort to support client-only usage, but this is not currently available.

## Differences from other sorting mods

- Server-side functionality by default
- Works with vanilla clients
- Fully configurable
- Focused feature set with minimal overhead

## Project status

The mod was originally developed by [Kyrptonaught](http://github.com/kyrptonaught). 
As of Minecraft 1.21.5, it is under active maintenance with a focus on compatibility, 
documentation, and long-term support by [Meza](https://github.com/meza).
